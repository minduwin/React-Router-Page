                The Nintendo Switch is a hybrid video game console developed by Nintendo. 
                It's unique for its ability to be used as both a home console connected 
                to a TV and as a portable handheld device. 
                This versatility is a key feature, allowing users to switch between 
                different play styles seamlessly.
